# Toward Robust Uncertainty Estimation with Random Activation Functions

This is the code used for performing the experiments from out paper, called "Toward Robust Uncertainty Estimation with Random Activation Functions". Our proposed method, the _Random Activation Functions (RAFs) Ensemble_, is evaluated against five popular baselines (i) Deep Ensemble (DE) [1], Neural Tangent Kernel Gaussian Process Parameter Ensemble (NTKGP-param) [2], Anchored Ensemble (AE) [3], Bootstrapped Ensemble of NNs Coupled with Random Priors (RP-param) [4], and Hyperdeep Ensemble (HDE) [5]. The experiments are described and discussed in detail in the paper.


## A. Requirements

* Python>=3.9

## B. Dependencies

First prepare and activate your python environment (e.g. `conda`). Then, to perform the regression experiments use the requirments.txt from the folder regression.  
Using pip:
```bash
$ pip install -r requirements.txt

```

## C. Main Regression Experiments

### How to run 

First navigate to the folder _main_experiments_.
